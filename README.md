# Iris Classification API
#### This project provides a RESTful API for classifying Iris flowers using a machine learning model. The API is built with FastAPI and utilizes a pre-trained classifier model loaded with pickle.

## Project Structure
main.py: The main FastAPI application file. It defines the API endpoints and handles predictions.
base.py: Contains the Pydantic model for request validation.
model.pkl: The pre-trained Iris classification model.
## Installation
To get started, you'll need Python 3.7+ and pip. First, clone the repository:

## Acknowledgements
FastAPI for building high-performance APIs.
scikit-learn for providing powerful machine learning tools.
